# Vision-based-Social-Distancing-Monitor

This project proposes to implement a computer vision-based social distancing detector.

## Why Did We Build This?

COVID-19 has been a major threat of 2020. It has been six months and the researchers are working hard to develop the vaccines for this virus. We are bound to reduce the spread of this virus in order to win this pandemic. So, it is our responsibility to wash our hands and follow social distancing practices. Although we try to follow social distancing, some people are not responsible to maintain distance or stand away from the neighboring person.

## Working of the Project ðŸ”­

To test the real-time scenario, we deployed it on one of the rooms to test how possibly it could be used and the results were pretty affirmative.   link
