# Vision-based-Social-Distancing-Monitor

This project proposes to implement a computer vision-based social distancing detector.

## Why Did We Build This?

COVID-19 has been a major threat of 2020. It has been six months and the researchers are working hard to develop the vaccines for this virus. We are bound to reduce the spread of this virus in order to win this pandemic. So, it is our responsibility to wash our hands and follow social distancing practices. Although we try to follow social distancing, some people are not responsible to maintain distance or stand away from the neighboring person.

Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.

To avoid getting infected or spreading it, It is essential to maintain social distancing while going out from home especially to public places such as markets or hospitals.

## Idea and Working PrototypeðŸ’¡

The system is designed to detect the people from the Camera or Video feed and to determine the distance between the humans to classify whether they maintain social distancing or not. Using the above data, we can decide how to take countermeasures if they do not follow frequently. This project can be used in the hospital, market, bus terminals, restaurants, and other public gatherings where the monitoring has to be done.

This project consists of a camera that will capture the image of the people entering public places and measure social distancing among them using the distance features.

To test the real-time scenario, we have fed the video stream to the system to test how possibly it could be used and the results were pretty affirmative.

## Working of the Project ðŸ”­

To test the real-time scenario, we deployed it on one of the rooms to test how possibly it could be used and the results were pretty affirmative.   link
